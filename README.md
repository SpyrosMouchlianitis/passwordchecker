# passwordchecker
The user inputs a password and the programm checks how strong is the password depending on 5 factors:
1. The length of the password is between 6-20 characters
2. The password has at least 1 upper case and 1 lower case character
3. The password has at least 1 digit
4. There are no same letters in a row e.x(...aaa...bbb...)
5. The password has symbols
